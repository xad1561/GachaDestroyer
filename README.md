A trojan that deletes some gacha games and blocks their related domains, preventing them from being played
Must be run with admin privileges to block domains

Running the program without arguments does nothing useful

Usage:

GachaDestroyer --DELETE --BLOCK
--DELETE to delete the games from their default directories, quite dumb and the games can be easily reinstalled if they are deleted
--BLOCK to block some related domains using the hosts file, which should prevent updates or the use of the launcher
