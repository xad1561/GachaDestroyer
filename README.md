A trojan that deletes some gacha games (Genshin Impact, Honkai Star Rail, Honkai 3rd) and blocks their related domains, preventing them from being played or downloaded again if deleted  
Might help with someone's gambling addiction. Maybe.  

Must be run from a command prompt or a batch file  
Must be run with admin privileges to block domains  
Running the program without arguments does nothing useful   

Usage:  

```
GachaDestroyer --DELETE --BLOCK  
```

--DELETE to delete the games from their default directories, quite dumb and the games can be easily reinstalled if they are deleted  
--BLOCK to block some related domains using the hosts file, which should prevent updates or the use of the launcher, but requires it to be run as admin
